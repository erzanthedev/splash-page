# 🌟 Splash Page Project 🌟

Welcome to my Splash Page project! A splash page is a web page that serves as an introduction or welcome screen before directing users to the main content. It often includes eye-catching visuals, branding elements, and a call to action.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

I started this project with a Figma handover design, using it as a blueprint to build the splash page.
I began with HTML and CSS to create the structure and styling of the user interface, ensuring it matched the design.
I then incorporated JavaScript for additional functionality.

## ✨ Purpose

The primary goal of this project was to learn how to use a Figma design handover as a developer to build a website or webpage, specifically a splash page.
The focus was on ensuring that the final product looked exactly like the design provided.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **HTML & CSS**: Strengthened my skills in building and styling web pages to match specific designs.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Implemented JavaScript to toggle between three custom backgrounds, enhancing the visual appeal of the splash page.
- **Figma Design Handover**: Gained experience in interpreting and accurately implementing a Figma design into a functional web page.

## ⚙️ Features

- **HTML and CSS**: Used for building the structure and styling the UI.
- **JavaScript**: Added functionality to toggle between three custom backgrounds.
- **Pixel-Perfect Design**: Ensured the splash page looks exactly like the Figma design handover.
